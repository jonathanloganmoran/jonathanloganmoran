*   Classification with the Scikit-learn `digits` dataset
*   ID3 algorithm from scratch

Often times, classification can be framed as a sort of questioning-answering system. Questions are asked about the input data which aid the model in determining a prediction. One example of a "question" that a model might ask is _does this input image contain this attribute value?_ Decision trees naturally help to structure this kind of if-then hierarchical decision-making by defining a series of questions that lead to a class label or value. In this article, we will explore several algorithms for constructing the two types of decision trees: the [ID3 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) for Classification Trees and [CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees_.28CART.29) analysis for Regression Trees. We'll start with the CART Regression Tree implementation from Scikit-learn and eventually work our way to the ID3 algorithm. While reading along, you will be able to implement your own ID3 algorithm from scratch using the code provided in this notebook. Let's get started...


## 1. Built in Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier`
_Objective #1_: Use and experiment with the built-in Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier` (based on CART)

#### Scikit-learn digits dataset

_1. Load the `digits` dataset from the datasets provided in Scikit-learn. Inspect the data. What is in there?_
For this classification task, we will be using the Scikit-learn `digits` dataset. Recall that the `digits` dataset consists of 1797 samples across 10 classes. Each sample is an 8x8 image of a single handwritten digit from 0 to 9. Each sample therefore has 64 features, where each of the 64 features is a brightness value of a pixel in the image.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
```


```python
digits = load_digits()
```

Now that we've got our data loaded, let's take a look at a sample of the images in the dataset.

```python
digits.data
```




    array([[ 0.,  0.,  5., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0., ..., 10.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0., ..., 16.,  9.,  0.],
           ...,
           [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  6.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  2., ..., 12.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0., 10., ..., 12.,  1.,  0.]])



We can see from the above that each pixel is stored in an array. The pixel value is represented by an integer between 0 and 16. To get a better look at the data _visually_, we can run the following code to preview a few samples of each class chosen at random.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
def visualize_random(images, labels, examples_per_class=8):
    """
    Display a sample of randomly selected images per class
    """
    number_of_classes = len(np.unique(labels))
    
    for cls in range(number_of_classes):
        idxs = np.where(labels == cls)[0]
        idxs = np.random.choice(idxs, examples_per_class, replace=False)
        for i, idx in enumerate(idxs):
            plt.subplot(examples_per_class, number_of_classes, i * number_of_classes + cls + 1)
            plt.imshow(images[idx].astype('uint8'), cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')
            plt.axis('off')
            if i == 0:
                plt.title(str(cls))
    plt.show()
```


```python
visualize_random(digits.images, digits.target, examples_per_class=8)
```


<img class="output" alt="Output 1. Random sample of Scikit-learn digits from each class 0-9." src="assets/images/jupyter/2019-11-15/2019-11-15-Decision-Trees-output-1.png">
    


_2. Split your data set into 70% training data (features and labels), and 30% test data._


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```


```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target, test_size=0.3)
```


```python
print("Number of training examples: ",len(X_train))
print("Number of test examples: ",len(X_test))
print("Number of total examples:", len(digits.data))
```

    Number of training examples:  1257
    Number of test examples:  540
    Number of total examples: 1797


**NOTE**: We would typically rescale the images' pixel values prior to running the data through our model. In the case of the `digits` data, the pixel values are in the range `[0-16]`. In order to rescale the images, we would divide the pixel values by a factor equal to the maximum pixel value (`16.0`). This would transform every pixel value from the range `[0-16]` to `[0,1]`.

Rescaling, in general cases, is important for two main reasons: 
1. Maintaining consistency across datasets whose images have differing pixel ranges, and
2. Preserving the learning rate across the data.

Without scaling, images with higher pixel ranges contribute more to the loss than those with lower ranges. The learning rate cannot update effectively to compensate for this if the images have different or high ranges.

Now, with that out of the wayâ€“we **will not** be scaling the `digits` data for use with the ID3-algorithm. Decision trees are said to be invariant to feature scaling, and in the case of the ID3-algorithm, scaling the image data to continuous values could actually result in overfitting (many more branch points at each split). Continuous attribute values like scaled pixel intensities can also be more time-consuming to process with the ID3-algorithm (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm#Properties)).



#### Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier`

_3. Set up a `DecisionTreeClassifier` as it comes in Scikit-learn. Use it with default parameters to train a decision tree classifier for the `digits` dataset based on the training data. Follow the tutorial (or the respective documentation) and produce a plot of the tree with `graphviz` if you have it available. What can you learn from this about how the used algorithm handles the data?_


As mentioned earlier, Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` is based on the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm. Like the name suggests, CART can produce either Classification or Regression trees depending on whether the dependent variable (the _target_ or _class_ variable) is categorical or continuous, respectively. Both the ID3 and CART algorithm are _greedy_ algorithms, meaning that they both choose the "best" feature locally that splits the data with the greatest _discriminative power_. In statistic and machine learning, a _discriminator_ is a model that divides a set of classes or categories of items. So, the term _discriminative power_ refers to how effective a discriminator is at categorising or dividing items correctly.

What is different about the CART and ID3 algorithms, however, are the functions used to calculate discriminative power. Referred to as the _splitting criterion_, the CART algorithm uses Gini impurity as a measure of non-homogeneity, whereas the ID3 algorithm uses information gain as its splitting criterion. While the difference between these two formulas will not be discussed in this notebook, you may choose to read more about them in-detail [here](https://scientistcafe.com/ids/splitting-criteria.html).



```python
from sklearn import tree
```

```python
# Initialising with default parameters
classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
```

The `DecisionTreeClassifier` is capable of performing multinomial (multi-class) classification on a dataset. We will initialise the decision tree learner with its default parameters for now, then attempt to optimise it by tweaking the `criterion`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`. If you want to get a head start on what these parameters are, check out the official `scikit-learn` documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier).

```python
# Fitting the decision tree on training set
sklearnDigitsTree = classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Calling the `fit()` method on our `digits` training data will build a corresponding decision tree model. Without getting into the specifics of the exact implementation, our decision tree algorithm will run as follows:

1.   Select the best attribute which splits the data.
2.   Make that attribute a decision node and break the data into subsets.
3.   Recursively build branches for each child until one of the stopping crtieria are met:
	    *   There are no remaining samples to split, or
	    *   There are no remaining attributes to split on (all samples are of the same class).


```python
# Visualising the tree using scikit-learn
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree, export_text
```
The following bit of code lets us display the resulting decision tree within our Jupyter notebook.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))
tree.plot_tree(sklearnDigitsTree)
plt.show()
```



<img class="figure" alt="Output 2. Scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier decision tree fit on digits dataset (default parameters)." src="assets/images/jupyter/2019-11-15/2019-11-15-Decision-Trees-output-2.png">


There are other ways to visualise a decision tree, one of which involves the use of the Python `graphviz` library. Since we are writing our own model in the later part of the notebook, we will install the requirement here (now is also a good time to make sure that the `pydot` dependency is installed).

```python
# Visualising the tree using graphviz
!pip install graphviz
```

    Requirement already satisfied: graphviz in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (0.10.1)


_4. Test the classifier with the remaining test data and analyse it using the metrics packages of Scikit-learn (`classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`). What do you see?_


Now, we will perform a prediction run over the test data using the decision tree that we previously fit. In essence, the test samples will be classified by sorting them down the tree from the root to a leaf/terminal node where a class label is provided. Each node in the tree acts as a test case for some attribute (i.e. an "if" statement), and each edge descending from the node corresponds to the possible answers to the test case (KDnuggets, 2020).
```python
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
```


```python
from sklearn import metrics
from mlxtend.plotting import plot_confusion_matrix
```

Computing a confusion matrix and obtaining our model accuracy...

```python
print('Scikit-learn Decision Tree Classifier on digits dataset... \n')
print('-'*10 + 'Classification Report' + '-'*5)
print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print('-'*10 + 'Confusion Matrix' + '-'*10)
plot_confusion_matrix(metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

Great, we've classified our test set images using the fitted decision tree. As we saw in the confusion matrix, our model wasn't perfect. We notice some misclassifications, especially with the `1` and `8` digit images. The following code will let us display a random sample of test images and their predicted labels.


```python
def visualize_predictions(images, labels, examples_per_class):
    """
    Display a sample of randomly selected images and their predicted labels
    """
    #images_and_predictions = list(zip(images, labels))
    number_of_classes = len(np.unique(labels))
    for cls in range(number_of_classes):
        idxs = np.where(labels == cls)[0]
        idxs = np.random.choice(idxs, examples_per_class, replace=False)
        for i, idx in enumerate(idxs):
            plt.subplot(examples_per_class, number_of_classes, i * number_of_classes + cls + 1)
            plt.imshow(images[idx].astype('uint8'), cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')
            plt.axis('off')
            if i == 0:
                plt.title('%s' % str(cls))
    plt.show()
```


```python
# Reshape test data to 3D
X_test_images = X_test.reshape((len(X_test),8,8))
```


```python

```

In the next section, we will modify a few of the `DecisionTreeClassifier` parameters and see if we can optimise our model.


#### Modifying the Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier`

_5. Change the parameters of the classifier, e.g., the minimum number of samples in a leaf / for a split, to see how the tree and the results are affected._

Parameters modified:
*  `criterion`: specifies the function to use to measure the quality of a split.

We'll first modify the Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier` by setting our splitting criterion (the function that measures discriminatory power) to `entropy`. This allows us to calculate _information gain_ for each attribute rather than the Scikit-learn default of Gini impurity. The resulting classifier's performance can be compared to our own ID3-algorithm we will be coding from scratch, which also uses information gain as its splitting criterion. This will be covered in the later part of the notebook. For now, let's see how our results with the `DecisionTreeClassifier` are impacted by this change.



```python
# Using information gain to determine best split
classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy')
```


```python
# Fitting decision tree on training set
id3esqueTree = classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


```python
# Visualising the new tree
```


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))
tree.plot_tree(id3esqueTree)
plt.show()
```

```

    ----------Confusion Matrix----------

    
<img class="cf_matrix" alt="Output 6. Confusion matrix for Scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier on digits dataset (using information gain)." src="assets/images/jupyter/2019-11-15/2019-11-15-Decision-Trees-output-6.png">

Great, we now have a reasonable model to compare to later on when we've constructed our own ID3-algorithm. Before we jump into writing our code, let's try one more modification to the Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier`. The parameters that we will modify below are rather difficult to implement in our own version, so it's best to test them out now.

Parameters modified:
*  `max_depth`: the maximum depth of the tree (default is until all nodes are leaves).
*  `min_samples_split`: the minimum number of samples to split an internal node.
*  `min_samples_leaf`: the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.

There are a few reasons why we would want to modify the above parameters in practice. Let's start with `max_depth`. The theoretical maximum depth of a decision tree is one less than the number of samples in the training set. A decision tree with this depth is, however, undesirable. The deeper the tree grows, the more complex the model becomes. The more attribute splits there are, the higher than chance of _overfitting_ of the training data. Thus, reducing the maximum depth of the decision tree is one way to prevent overfitting.


```python
def test_depth(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, max_depth=10):
    """
    Calculates the average F1 score over ten training runs for each model variation.
    Each model is tested with a max_depth from 10 to max_depth, inclusive.
    """
    f1_scores = {}
    for i in range(10, max_depth+1):
        f1s = []
        for exp in range(10):
            model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=i)
            model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
            # Multi-class F1 requires 'macro' or 'weighted' average
            # We choose 'macro' as our training set is relatively balanced
            f1s.append(metrics.f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro'))
        f1_scores[i] = np.mean(f1s)
    return f1_scores
```


```python
f1_scores = test_depth(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, max_depth=20)
```

To find the best performing model, we will use Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV`. This handy method allows us to test each hyperparameter combination on a given classifier and find the best combination from the _parameter grid_ we specified. This works by exhaustively searching the parameter space using cross-validation method. One limitation to this approach is that we have to manually set a range of values to try for each hyperparameter. To better determine this, consult a research paper that uses a similar model and dataset. We chose our value ranges from the recommendations in [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-tune-a-decision-tree-f03721801680) blog post on tuning decision trees.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
```


```python
# Parameters to test (see above)
params = {'max_depth': range(10,21),
          'min_samples_split': range(1,41),
          'min_samples_leaf': range(1,21)}
```

```python
# Perform cross-validated grid-search over parameter grid
grid = GridSearchCV(tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(),
                    # Parameters and their values to test in dict format 
                    param_grid=params,
                    # Cross-validation method (int=k folds for KFold)

                    # Print computation time for each fold and parameter candidate

_Forewarning_: running `GridSearchCV` could take quite a long time (up to 15 minutes, in our case). Make sure that you have a decent computer or access to one. Google Colab provides a great (and free!) cloud service that handles this task fairly well.

The following returns the combination of hyperparameter values that gave us the best results.
```python
# Parameter setting that gave the best results
grid.best_params_
```




    {'max_depth': 13, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2}



It looks like our best `max_depth` value has changed slightly. Interestingly, the best reported values for `min_samples_leaf` and `min_samples_split` are the default ones in `scikit-learn`. Let's see how the classifier performed with the hyperparameter combination...

```python
# Mean cross-validated score of the best estimator
grid.best_score_
```




    0.8767365079365079



Not bad! It looks like a bit of hyperparameter tuning was able to improve the stock `DecisionTreeClassifier` accuracy by several percentage points. Don't get too excited, though. We have to still perform our train-test routine with this hyperparameter combination to get a better idea of the true predictive performance of the model. `GridSearchCV` only reports the mean cross-validated "score" during training and does not evaluate the performance on a test set. 

Each parameter's performance is returned in a nested dictionary object. Using the following method, we can visualise the mean score of each hyperparameter value.

## 2. Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm
_Objective #2:_ Implementing our own decision tree classifier based on the ID3 algorithm...


In the first part of this article, we framed classification as a kind of questioning-answering problem. We discussed how a decision tree naturally structures this type of hierarchial decision-making system. We then introduced the basic idea of the decision tree algorithm and lightly covered the general strategy of recursively building subtrees by splitting data into subsets based on an optimal attribute. To demonstrate this process, we applied a Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier` (implemented with CART) to the `digits` dataset. We saw what the resulting tree structure looked like, then measured its performance by classifying the test data subset. Lastly, we tuned a few hyperparameters like `max_depth`, which acts to _minimise_ the depth of the tree (the number of 'questions' asked).

In this section, we will write our own algorithm from scratch, following the same general algorithm for decision trees we saw earlier. However, in our implementation we will be modifying the _splititng criterion_ to follow the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm. To review, the splitting criterion is a function used to measure which 'questions' provide the most value when it comes to separating the data. The ID3 algorithm selects the most useful attributes by introducing a metric known as _information gain_.

Information gain determines which questions (attributes) have the 'most value' by calculating their respective entropy reduction in terms of [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). We can express this entropy calculation for a given discrete random variable $$ X $$ as $$ H(X) $$. At the highest level, information gain $$ IG(T,a) $$ can then be thought of as simple difference formula between the _a prior_ Shannon entropy $$ H(T) $$ of data set $$ T $$ and the conditional entropy $$ H(T\mid a) $$ after splitting that dataset on attribute $$ a $$. Thus,  information gain is expressed as

<img class="latex" alt="Formula for information gain as the difference between the a priori entropy of data set T and the conditional entropy of attribute a." src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce1cc627a4c7795af67661345fb6d544ac53a31e"> where the conditional entropy is given as

<img class="latex" alt="Formula for conditional entropy of attribute a in training set T." src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcc4880c5a423d5ad01265721d124f010c4a1e1b">


Given a discrete random variable $$ X $$ with possible outcomes $$ x_{1},...,x_{n} $$, which occur with probability $$ P(x_{1}),...,P(x_{n}) $$, we can then define the Shannon entropy $$ H(X) $$ to be
<img class="latex" alt="Formula for the entropy of discrete random variable X." src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3616dee43f6287d4a4e2a557de8d48ad24926">

where $$ \sum $$ denotes the sum over the variable's possible values. In our application, we will be choosing $$ log $$ to be of Base 2 with units of bits as "[shannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_(unit))".

To build our decision tree branch-by-branch, we perform the above calculations in a four-step process at each recursive call:

1.   Calculate the prior entropy of the data set.
2.   Calculate the information gain for each attribute.
3.   Select the attribute with the maximal information gain.
4.   Partition the dataset based on the best attribute's values.

Like the CART decision tree algorithm we covered in the first section of this article, we stop performing the above when any of the following conditions are met:

*   There are no remaining samples to split, or
*   There are no remaining attributes to split on (all samples are of the same class).


#### The ID3 algorithm in pseudocode
```
ID3 (Samples, Target_Attribute, Attributes)
  Create a (root) node Root for the tree

  If all samples belong to one class <class_name>
      Return the single-node tree Root, with label = <class_name>. 
  
  If Attributes is empty, then 
      Return the single node tree Root, with label = most common class value in Samples.
  else 
      Begin
          Let A be the attribute a in Attributes that generates the maximum information gain 
                when the tree is split based on a.

          Set A as the target_attribute of Root

          For each possible value, v, of A, add a new tree branch below Root, 
               corresponding to the test A == v, i.e.,
              Let Samples(v) be the subset of samples that have the value v for A.
              If Samples(v) is empty, then 
                  Below this new branch add a leaf node with label 
                        = most common class value in Samples. 
              else
                  Below this new branch add the subtree ID3 (Samples(v), A, Attributes/{A}) 
        End 
  Return Root
```

_1. Make a decision regarding the data structure that your tree should be able to handle. In the code below, you will find the tree assumed to be implemented with nodes that are dictionaries._


We will be using the `Handout_SkeletonDT` code provided to us by _E.A. Topp_ (EDAN95, link [here](http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Education/EDAN95/Handouts/DT_LabHandout.zip)) to help us get started on our ID3 decision tree algorithm. Examine the `ID3DecisionTreeClassifierSkeleton` class a bit to understand how we will implement nodes and visualise them in a graph using the `pydot` library.


```python
from collections import Counter
from graphviz import Digraph



class ID3DecisionTreeClassifierSkeleton:


    def __init__(self, minSamplesLeaf = 1, minSamplesSplit = 2):

        self.__nodeCounter = 0

        # the graph to visualise the tree
        self.__dot = Digraph(comment='The Decision Tree')

        # suggested attributes of the classifier to handle training parameters
        self.__minSamplesLeaf = minSamplesLeaf
        self.__minSamplesSplit = minSamplesSplit


    # Create a new node in the tree with the suggested attributes for the visualisation.
    # It can later be added to the graph with the respective function
    def new_ID3_node(self):
        node = {'id': self.__nodeCounter, 'label': None, 'attribute': None, 'entropy': None, 'samples': None,
                         'classCounts': None, 'nodes': None}

        self.__nodeCounter += 1
        return node

    # adds the node into the graph for visualisation (creates a dot-node)
    def add_node_to_graph(self, node, parentid=-1):
        nodeString = ''
        for k in node:
            if ((node[k] != None) and (k != 'nodes')):
                nodeString += "\n" + str(k) + ": " + str(node[k])

        self.__dot.node(str(node['id']), label=nodeString)
        if (parentid != -1):
            self.__dot.edge(str(parentid), str(node['id']))
            nodeString += "\n" + str(parentid) + " -> " + str(node['id'])

        print(nodeString)

        return


    # make the visualisation available
    def make_dot_data(self):
        return self.__dot


    # For you to fill in; Suggested function to find the best attribute to split with, given the set of
    # remaining attributes, the currently evaluated data and target.
    def find_split_attr(self):

        # Change this to make some more sense
        return None


    # the entry point for the recursive ID3-algorithm, you need to fill in the calls to your recursive implementation
    def fit(self, data, target, attributes, classes):

        # fill in something more sensible here... root should become the output of the recursive tree creation
        root = self.new_ID3_node()
        self.add_node_to_graph(root)

        return root



    def predict(self, data, tree):
        predicted = list()

        # fill in something more sensible here... root should become the output of the recursive tree creation
        return predicted
```

_2. Inspect other parts of the code provided. You will find one example for how it is easily possible to construct the visualisation data (`dot-data`) for the `graphviz`-visualisation in parallel to the actual decision tree. Whenever a node is added to the tree, it can also immediately be added to the graph. Feel free to use this for your own implementation._


In the above implementation we visualise our decision tree by calling the `make_dot_data()` method on a tree object that has been fitted (trained). We then wish to save a PDF of the visualised tree, which we can do by calling `render()` and passing in a desired filename.
```python
# Initialise the decision tree model
clf = ID3()
# Fit on training data (build tree)
example_tree = clf.fit(train_data, train_labels)
# Construct pydot-node visualisation
plot = example_tree.make_dot_data()
# Save to PDF
plot.render("testTree")
```

In order to implement the desired functionality above, we need to install a few dependencies.

```python
# Render PDF in image format to display tree inline
!pip install pdf2image
```

    for idx,page in enumerate(pages):
        img_path = Path(str(img_name) + '_page' + str(idx)).with_suffix('.jpg')
        page.save(img_path, 'JPEG')
        plt.figure()
        plt.title(img_name)
        img = Image.open(img_path)
        plt.imshow(img)
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.show()
```

_3. Simply running `main` in the handout will produce a tree with one node, visualised in `testTree.pdf`. Make sure that this works, i.e., that you have all the necessary libraries installed._

In order to test our decision tree, we will first use a rather simple toy dataset. This dataset is split into `attributes`, `classes`, `target` and `data`. A description of each follows:
*   `attributes`: list of tuples in the form `(attribute_name, [list, of, attribute, values])`
*   `classes`: tuple of the unique classes (positive or negative)
*   `data`: list of training examples as tuples that contain the respective attribute values for each unique attribute in `attributes`
*   `target`: tuple of class labels for each example in `data`
*   `testData`: list of test examples as tuples that contain the respective attribute values for each unique attribute in `attributes`
*   `testTarget`: tuple of class labels for each example in `testData`

```python
### From `ToyData.py` in E.A. Topp's `Handout_SkeletonDT`
```


```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class ToyData:

    def __init__(self):
        self.attributes = OrderedDict(
            [("color", ["y", "g", "b"]), ("size", ["s", "l"]), ("shape", ["r", "i"])]
        )
        self.classes = ('+', '-')

        self.data = [('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('g', 's', 'i'),
                 ('g', 'l', 'i'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('g', 's', 'r'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'i'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'i')]
        self.target = ('+', '-', '+', '-', '+', '+', '+', '+', '-', '-', '+', '-', '-', '-', '+', '+')

        self.testData = [('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('y', 's', 'r'),
                 ('g', 's', 'i'),
                 ('b', 'l', 'i'),
                 ('y', 'l', 'r')]

        self.testTarget = ('+', '-', '+', '-', '+')

    def get_data(self):
        return self.attributes, self.classes, self.data, self.target, self.testData, self.testTarget
```

As mentioned in _Step 3_, running the following code should produce a decision tree that contains a single node with `id: 0`. Nothing interesting can be said just yet about the resulting tree, but our goal is rather to test that our visualisation libraries are properly installed.

```python
### From `main.py` in E.A. Topp's `Handout_SkeletonDT`
```


```python
#import ToyData as td
#import ID3

import numpy as np
from sklearn import tree, metrics, datasets


def main():
	# Get data from ToyData
    attributes, classes, data, target, data2, target2 = ToyData().get_data()
    # Initialise decision tree model
    id3_test = ID3DecisionTreeClassifierSkeleton()
    # Fit the decision tree on ToyData (build tree)
    myTree = id3_test.fit(data, target, attributes, classes)
    print(myTree)
    # Visualise nodes using pydot
    plot = id3_test.make_dot_data()
    # Save to PDF
    plot.render("testTree")
    # Run a "prediction" over the test data
    predicted = id3_test.predict(data2, myTree)
    print(predicted)


if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```


```python
# Visualise the tree and verify that a single node is produced

#### The ID3 Decision Tree Classifier

_4. The code handout contains a mere skeleton for the ID3 classifier. Implement what is needed to actually construct a decision tree classifier. Implement the ID3 algorithm, e.g., according to what is provided in the lecture or on this page below. Use information gain as criterion for the best split attribute._


Now, the moment we have been waiting for. It's finally time to write our very own ID3 Decision Tree Classifier. Follow the code below and you'll be up and running in no time. The code is heavily documented with plenty of comments to help guide you through the implementation from top to bottom.

We successfully fit a decision tree on the `ToyData` dataset using our very own ID3 algorithm! In essence, our algorithm has figured out which 'questions' to ask about the attribute value pairs in the test data to identify whether or not a given example is either positive (`+`) or negative (`-`). The leaves in our tree (nodes at the bottom of the graph) are the predicted labels, or 'answers', for our input data. Once an input example reaches one of these leaf nodes, we assume it to be of the same class as the respective leaf node.

#### Predicting with a Decision Tree
The prediction (finding the class for an example `x`) with a decision tree boils then obviously down to a tree search, which follows the branch of the tree that represents the combinations of attribute values given in `x` until a leaf is reached. The predicted class for `x` is then the class that the leaf is labelled with. This is, again, easiest implemented recursively:

```
predict_rek( node, x)
    if node is leaf
        return the class label of node
    else
        find the child c among the children of node
             representing the value that x has for
             the split_attribute of node
        return predict_rek( c, x)
```


```python
# Run prediction over test data
y_pred = id3.predict(data2, toyTree)
```


```python
print('ID3 Decision Tree Classifier on ToyData dataset... \n')
print('-'*10 + 'Classification Report' + '-'*5)
print(metrics.classification_report(target2, y_pred))
print('-'*10 + 'Confusion Matrix' + '-'*10)
plot_confusion_matrix(metrics.confusion_matrix(target2, y_pred))
```

#### Testing ID3 with Scikit-learn digits

_6. When you are sure that everything works properly, run the ID3-training for the digits training data you used in part 1. Do not constrain the training, i.e., run with default parameters. What do you see in the plot? Analyse the result (produce a confusion matrix and a classification report) and compare with the result from part 1 (when running with default parameters)._


```python
# Split digits data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target, test_size=0.3)
```


```python
# Get attributes and classes for digits data
attributes = list(np.unique(X_train))
# Convert to tuple format for ID3 classifier
classes = tuple(np.unique(y_train))
```


```python
# Initialise decision tree model
id3 = ID3DecisionTreeClassifier()
```


```python
# Fit on digits training data (build tree)
digitsTree = id3.fit(X_train, y_train, attributes, classes, dataset="digits")
```



```python
# Visualise tree with Graphviz
plot = id3.make_dot_data()
# Render tree in PDF
plot.render("myDigitsTree")
```

Due to the size of the tree, we're unable to render it on a single PDF page. Run the code for yourself to visualise the results :-)

```python
# Prediction over digits test data
y_pred = id3.predict(X_test, digitsTree, dataset="digits")
```


```python
print('ID3 Decision Tree Classifier on Scikit-learn digits dataset... \n')
print('-'*10 + 'Classification Report' + '-'*5)
print(metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print('-'*10 + 'Confusion Matrix' + '-'*10)
plot_confusion_matrix(metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

#### Testing ID3 with modified (summarised) Scikit-learn digits

_7. One striking difference should be in the ratio of breadth and depth of the two trees. Why is that the case? Modify your data set to contain only three values for the attributes (instead of potentially 16), e.g., 'dark', 'grey', and 'light', with for example 'dark' representing pixel values <5.0, and 'light' those >10.0. Train and test the classifier again. Do your results improve? Can you match the SKLearn implementation's accuracy? If not, why do you think this is the case?_

Bins:
*  `Light`: 0-4  â€“>  0
*  `Grey`: 5-10 â€“>  1
*  `Dark`: 11-16 â€“>  2


```python
bin_bounds = [4, 10]
digits_data_summarised = np.digitize(digits.data, bins=bin_bounds, right=True)
digits_target_summarised = digits.target
```

```python
X_train_bin, X_test_bin, y_train_bin, y_test_bin = train_test_split(digits_data_summarised, digits_target_summarised, test_size=0.3)
```

```python
# Get attributes and classes for digits data
attributes_bin = list(np.unique(X_train_bin))
# Convert to tuple format for ID3 classifier
classes_bin = tuple(np.unique(y_train_bin))
```


```python
# Initialise decision tree model
id3 = ID3DecisionTreeClassifier()
```


```python
# Fit on digits summarised data (build tree)
digitsSummarisedTree = id3.fit(X_train_bin, y_train_bin, attributes_bin, classes_bin, dataset="digits_summarised")
```


```python
# Visualise tree with Graphviz
plot = id3.make_dot_data()
# Render tree in PDF

_8. (Bonus: If interested, explore the effects of different parameters regulating the depth of the tree, the maximum number of samples per leaf or required for a split, initially on the SKLearn version, but of course you can also implement them for your own classifier.)_
We'll leave this exercise to the reader.


Congratsâ€“you've reached the end of this article! By now, you should be familiar with decision trees for classification. You explored two popular decision tree algorithms: CART and ID3. You looked at the math behind the ID3 algorithm and wrote formulas to perform attribute selection using the information gain metric. You ran the CART and ID3 algorithms on data and measured their performance on multinomial classification. Lastly, you improved their results by (1) tweaking the hyperparameters and (2) modifying the data's attribute values. While there is always more content to explore, we hope that this has been a fun and informative introduction for you.
