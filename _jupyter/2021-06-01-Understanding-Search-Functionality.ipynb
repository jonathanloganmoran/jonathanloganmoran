    "# Understanding Search Functionality\n",
    "In this Part 2 of three case studies investigating Yammerâ€“a social network for the workplace, we will be helping the product team determine priorities for their next development cycle. They are considering improving the site's search functionality, but first need our help deciding whether or not to work on the project in the first place. Thus, it's our job to consider the impact that search has on users, and see if there's any specific improvements that can be made. We'll be making recommendations to the development team, so it's best that we form quantitative hypotheses that seek to understand the general quality of an inidividual user's search experience.\n",

    "If a user clicks many links in the search results, it's likely that she isn't having a great experience. However, the inverse is not necessarily trueâ€“clicking only one result does not imply a success. If the user clicks through one result, then refines their search, that's certainly not a great experience, so search frequently is probably a better way to understand that piece of the puzzle. Clickthroughs are, however, very useful in determining whether search rankings are good. If users frequently click low results or scroll to additional pages, then the ranking algorithm should probably be adjusted.\n",
